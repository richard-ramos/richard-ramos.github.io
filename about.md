Hello and welcome!, My name is Richard Ramos. I'm a human being who is also a software engineer, working remotely at [Embark Labs](https://embarklabs.io), a team that builds tools for creating decentralized software at [Status.im](https://status.im). 

I am a computer/electronics enthusiast. I enjoy all aspects of computers from software to hardware, being the later the main motivator for learning some basics electronics. I also like other topics like privacy, fitness, self-sustanaibility /off-the-grid and self-improvement. I dedicate most of my free time in all these activities, working on random DIY projects or spending some time off with my family.

If you want to reach out, you can send me an email to [info@richardramos.me](mailto:info@richardramos.me).
Everything here is my own honest opinion and not representative of my past, present or future employeers.
